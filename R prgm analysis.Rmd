## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
hist(mobilestoredata$Net.Amount, main = "Distribution of Net Amount")
plot(mobilestoredata$No.Of.days, mobilestoredata$Net.Amount, 
     xlab = "No of Items", ylab = "Net Amount", 
     main = "Net Amount vs. No of Items")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
hist(mobilestoredata$Net.Amount, main = "Distribution of Net Amount")
plot(mobilestoredata$No.Of.days, mobilestoredata$Net.Amount, 
     xlab = "No of Items", ylab = "Net Amount", 
     main = "Net Amount vs. No of Items")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
